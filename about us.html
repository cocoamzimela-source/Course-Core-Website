    <!-- Introduction to the Organization -->
    <section class="about-intro">
      <h1>About Course Core</h1>
      <p>
        Course Core was founded in 2023 by <b>Thandiswa Cocoa Mzimela</b> after completing her
        Bachelor in Computer Science in South Africa. She recognized a gap in IT education where
        students received a lot of theory and some practical work, but not enough to truly prepare
        them for real jobs in IT companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Course Core is run by Thandiswa, her team of front-end and back-end developers, and
        experienced lecturers who are passionate about sharing their knowledge. Our purpose is to help
        both beginners and professionals apply their skills practically, empowering developers to grow
        and succeed in real IT environments.
      </p>

    <!-- Mission and Vision -->
    <section class="mission-vision">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
